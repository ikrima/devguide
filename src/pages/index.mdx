Unreal Engine 4 Development Guide. These are my personal notes from the past 4 years that I'm transforming into our internal dev onboarding guide.

I'm aiming to process about one section a day since the conversion from onenote/evernote/confluence is lossy and needs a final human pass to clean up little niggles.
